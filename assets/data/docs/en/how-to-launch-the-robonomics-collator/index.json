Every additional full node of blockchain helps it to be more sustainable and fault tolerant. Robonomics node binaries is available in [release](https://github.com/airalab/robonomics/releases) assets or it could be [build from source](/docs/how-to-build-collator-node/).\n\n## Requirements\n\n**Minimum hardware requirements** for collator:\n+ 4-cores CPU\n+ 200GB NVMe\n+ 8GB RAM\n\nBut we recommend to launch collator using the **standard hardware requirements** for polkadot validators:\n+ CPU - Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-7700K CPU @ 4.20GHz.\n+ Storage - A NVMe solid state drive. Should be reasonably sized to deal with blockchain growth. In the moment just Kusama db used around 90GB space. Starting around 200-250GB will be okay for the first six months of Robonomics, but will need to be re-evaluated every six months.\n+ Memory - 64GB ECC\n\n\n## Simple launch the Robonomics collator\n\nYou can use simple launch directly in the command line just for first check for errors.\nAfter that we strongly recommend to launch the Robonomics as a service.\n\n```\nrobonomics \\\n  --parachain-id=2048 \\\n  --name=\"%NODE_NAME%\" \\\n  --validator \\\n  --lighthouse-account=\"%POLKADOT_ACCOUNT_ADDRESS%\" \\\n  --telemetry-url=\"wss://telemetry.parachain.robonomics.network/submit/ 0\" \\\n  -- \\\n  --database=RocksDb \\\n  --unsafe-pruning \\\n  --pruning=1000\n```\nWhere **%NODE_NAME%** is the node name, and\n      **%POLKADOT_ACCOUNT_ADDRESS%** is the account address in the Polkadot ecosystem in SS58 format. Example: *4Ch19e5HAF4PzudmLMVLD2xEyuxYXY4j47CLdsG74ht933Vz*\n\n\n\n## Launch the Robonomics collator as a service\n\n1. Create the user for the service with home directory\n    ```\n    useradd -m robonomics\n    ```\n\n2. Move the Robonomics binary to the */usr/local/bin/* directory. \n\n3. Create the the systemd service file named *robonomics.service*:\n    ```\n    nano /etc/systemd/system/robonomics.service\n    ```\n    And add to it these rows:\n    ```\n    [Unit]\n    Description=robonomics\n    After=network.target\n    \n    [Service]\n    User=robonomics\n    Group=robonomics\n    Type=simple\n    Restart=on-failure\n\n    ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/robonomics \\\n      --parachain-id=2048 \\\n      --name=\"%NODE_NAME%\" \\\n      --validator \\\n      --lighthouse-account=\"%POLKADOT_ACCOUNT_ADDRESS%\" \\\n      --telemetry-url=\"wss://telemetry.parachain.robonomics.network/submit/ 0\" \\\n      -- \\\n      --database=RocksDb \\\n      --unsafe-pruning \\\n      --pruning=1000\n\n    [Install]\n    WantedBy=multi-user.target\n    ```\n    Where \n      **%NODE_NAME%** is the node name, and\n      **%POLKADOT_ACCOUNT_ADDRESS%** is the account address in the Polkadot ecosystem in SS58 format. Example: *4Ch19e5HAF4PzudmLMVLD2xEyuxYXY4j47CLdsG74ht933Vz*\n\n4. Save this file, then enable and start the service:\n    ```\n    systemctl enable robonomics.service && systemctl start robonomics.service\n    ```\n\nTelemetry url: https://telemetry.parachain.robonomics.network/#/Robonomics\n\nHow to check the collator logs: `journalctl -u robonomics.service -f` \n\nNow the robonomics collator is launched, but Kusama chain syncronization process will take a lot of time, so we recommend to download the actual Kusama snapshot and use it. \n\n\n## Using Kusama snapshot for making syncronization faster\n\nWe recommend to do it immediately after creating the robonomics service. You can find info about snapshots and usage instructions on this page: https://ksm-rocksdb.polkashots.io/\n\nHere our instruction:\n\n1. Stop the Robonomics service and remove current Kusama database directory:\n    ```\n    systemctl stop robonomics.service\n    rm -rf /home/robonomics/.local/share/robonomics/polkadot/chains/ksmcc3/db/\n    ```\n    \n2. Download the actual snapshot, install 7z, unarchive the downloaded db and remove downloaded archive:\n    ```\n    wget https://ksm-rocksdb.polkashots.io/snapshot -O kusama.RocksDb.7z\n    apt install p7zip-full p7zip-rar\n    7z x kusama.RocksDb.7z -o/home/robonomics/.local/share/robonomics/polkadot/chains/ksmcc3\n    rm -v kusama.RocksDb.7z\n    ```\n    \n3. Set right owner for database folder:\n    ``` \n    chown -R robonomics:robonomics home/robonomics/.local/share/robonomics/polkadot/chains/ksmcc3\n    ```\n4. Start the Robonomics service again:\n    ```\n    systemctl start robonomics.service\n    ```\n    \n"}},"context":{}}
